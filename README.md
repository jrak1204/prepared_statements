<h1>Challenge 3: Vulnerable Java Test</h1>

The goal of this challenge is to assess if you can implement one of the standard application security defence techniques.


The repo contains a file that only has a simple snipped of java code.


The code contained within the snippet is vulnerable to a specific form of attack. 
This attack has a secure codeing defence mechanism that is common accross most languages.

Apply the defensive mechanism to the snippet. Do this and the challenge is complete.



Note:
 This code is not designed to be run, there is no requirement to add this to any sort of java class and run it.
